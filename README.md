# Full Stack User Management Application

## Project Description

This project is a **User Management Application** built using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js with Express** for the backend. It interacts with a **MongoDB** database for storing and managing user information. The application allows you to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data through a clean user interface.

### Key Features
- **Add New Users:** Fill out a form to add a new user with a name, email, and age.
- **View All Users:** Display all users stored in the MongoDB database in a card format.
- **Edit User Information:** Modify user details (Name, Email, Age).
- **Delete Users:** Remove users from the database with a single click.
- **Success/Error Notifications:** Display success or error messages after actions like adding or deleting a user.
- **Responsive Design:** The frontend is designed to be mobile-friendly and adapt to different screen sizes.
